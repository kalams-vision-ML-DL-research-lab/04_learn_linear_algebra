#In a laptop showroom there are laptops with RAM: 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB of different companies: A, B and C. Last week, the showroom sold 2, 1 and 3 laptops with 4GB RAM of companies A, B, and C respectively; 1, 2 and 1 laptops with 8GB RAM of companies A, B, and C respectively; and 2, 3 and 3 laptops with 16GB RAM of companies A, B and C respectively. The pricesof laptops with a particular GB Ram are the same irrespective of the company (i.e., laptops of companies A, B and C with 4GB RAM have the same price; similarly, laptopsof companies A, B and C with 8GB RAM have the same price; and laptopsof companies A, B and C with 16GB RAM have the same price). The owner of showroom earned â‚¹14, 17 and 18 (in ten thousand) in that week by selling laptop of companies A, B and C respectively.

Using the above information, form the system of linear equations and find the matrix representation of the system of linear equations to find the prices of 1 laptop with 4GB, 1 laptop with 8GM and 1 laptop 16 GB.
